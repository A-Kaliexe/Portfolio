            <h3>About Me</h3>        
            <p>I am a creative frontend developer. I am passionate in catering my works for ----- that make an impact, inspire and connect with people.</p><p> When I am not developing I enjoy spending times  reading some great books, playing games, or finding hidden gem restaurants.</p>
            <p>Hey there! I'm Kali. My journey into the world of coding began in an unexpected place: Myspace. It feels like ages ago now, but that's where I unknowingly took my first steps into the realm of coding. Playing around with customizing my profile sparked something inside me.
                As I continued through high school, I found myself drawn to writing more and more lines of HTML and CSS code. It was like unlocking a new language, one that allowed me to bring my creative visions to life on the screen.
                Despite my initial inclination towards a career in health, coding kept calling out to me. Years later, when I stumbled upon The Odin Project and GCode House, I saw it as a way to fill my spare time with something I enjoyed. Little did I know, it would ignite a fire within me.
                The journey through The Odin Project wasn't just about learning to code; it was about discovering a passion I didn't know I had. Each line of code I wrote felt like a piece of myself coming alive, a puzzle I couldn't wait to solve.
                Since then, I've thrown myself into mastering programming languages like JavaScript. It's been a journey of self-discovery and growth, one that has brought me here, eager to share my skills and make a meaningful contribution to your business.</p>
