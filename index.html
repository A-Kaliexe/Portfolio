            <h2>About Me</h2>        
            <p>I'm Kali, a frontend developer with a passion for creating impactful digital experiences. My coding journey began unexpectedly on Myspace, where I discovered a knack for customization that ignited my interest in coding.</p>
            
            <p>My journey into the world of coding began in an unexpected place: Myspace. It feels like ages ago now, but that's where I unknowingly took my first steps into the realm of coding. Playing around with customizing my profile sparked something inside me.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've immersed myself in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, constantly pushing myself to master new technologies and refine my skills. What started as a hobby has evolved into a fulfilling career focused on crafting intuitive and visually stunning websites.</p>
            
            <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring hidden gem restaurants, diving into captivating books, and occasionally losing myself in the world of gaming. These experiences fuel my creativity and inspire me to infuse every project with innovation and originality.</p>
            
            <p>With a background in health and a passion for technology, I bring a unique perspective to my work, striving to create digital solutions that not only meet but exceed client expectations. Let's collaborate to bring your vision to life!</p>

        <p id="aboutparagraph">Hey there! I'm Kali. My journey into the world of coding began in an unexpected place: Myspace. It feels like ages ago now, but that's where I unknowingly took my first steps into the realm of coding. Playing around with customizing my profile sparked something inside me.
            As I continued through high school, I found myself drawn to writing more and more lines of HTML and CSS code. It was like unlocking a new language, one that allowed me to bring my creative visions to life on the screen.
            Despite my initial inclination towards a career in health, coding kept calling out to me. Years later, when I stumbled upon The Odin Project and GCode House, I saw it as a way to fill my spare time with something I enjoyed. Little did I know, it would ignite a fire within me.
            The journey through The Odin Project wasn't just about learning to code; it was about discovering a passion I didn't know I had. Each line of code I wrote felt like a piece of myself coming alive, a puzzle I couldn't wait to solve.
            Since then, I've thrown myself into mastering programming languages like JavaScript. It's been a journey of self-discovery and growth, one that has brought me here, eager to share my skills and make a meaningful contribution to your business.</p>
